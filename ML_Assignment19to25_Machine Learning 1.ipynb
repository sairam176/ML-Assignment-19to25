    "Ensemble learning is used when you build component classifiers that are more accurate and independent from each other. The general principle of an ensemble method is to combine the predictions of several models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve robustness over a single model. Bagging is a method in ensemble for improving unstable estimation or classification schemes. While boosting method are used sequentially to reduce the bias of the combined model. Boosting and Bagging both can reduce errors by reducing the variance term."

    "By using a lot of data, overfitting can be avoided. Overfitting happens relatively as you have a small dataset, and you try to learn from it. In situations where you have a small dataset and you are forced to come with a model, you can use a technique known as cross validation. In this method, the dataset is split into two section, testing and training datasets. The testing dataset will only test the model while in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model. In this technique, a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. The idea of cross validation is to define a dataset to “test” the model in the training phase."
